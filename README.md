### Logistic Regression

```markdown

Logistic Regression model computes a weighted sum of the input features (plus a bias term)

$$\\hat{p} = h_\\theta(X) = \\sigma(\\theta ^ T * X)$$

The logistic or the logit, noted σ(·) is a sigmoid function that outputs a number between 0 and 1.

$$\\sigma(t) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp ( - t )} $$

```
